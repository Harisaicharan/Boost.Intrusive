Use c++14 for the segment tree library.

Usage:-

How to run unit test files ?

	g++ Iterator_test.cpp -std=c++14
	g++ Build_test.cpp -std=c++14
	g++ Update_test.cpp -std=c++14


Functions Implemented:

1) seg_build:

This function builds the segment tree given the input array and the merging function.

Inputs:

(start_index , end_index , input_array , total_size,merging_function)

start_index: the starting index of input_array from where the segment_tree needs to be built

end_index: the starting index of input_array from where the segment_tree needs to be built

input_array: The array on which segment_tree needs to be built

size: The total declared size of input_array

merging_function : the function that is used for merging between the parent node and children nodes.

Output:

It gives a tree with leaf nodes containing the elements of input array.

2) segtree_update:

This function updates the segment tree if there is an update at a single position in the input_array.

Inputs:

(start_index , end_index ,index ,input_array ,merging_function)

start_index: the starting index of input_array from where the segment_tree was built previously using built function

end_index: the starting index of input_array till where the segment_tree was built previously using built function

index: The updated index in the input_array.

input_array: The array on which segment_tree needs to be built

merging_function : the function that is used for merging between the parent node and children nodes.


3) segtree_query:

This function takes an interval as input and outputs the value given by the merging function.

Inputs:

(start_index , end_index ,query_start,query_end,initialiser,input_array ,merging_function)

start_index: the starting index of input_array from where the segment_tree was built previously using built function

end_index: the starting index of input_array till where the segment_tree was built previously using built function

query_start:The starting index of query.

query_end:The ending index of query.

initialiser: This is the value that will not effect the value that merging_function outputs

input_array: The array on which segment_tree needs to be built

merging_function : the function that is used for merging between the parent node and children nodes.

Output:

The value of merging function on the input interval.


4) begin:

This function returns a pointer which points to the first node of segment tree i.e root.

Inputs:

This has no inputs.

Output:

Returns the pointer that points to the root of segment tree.


5) get_parent:

This function returns a pointer which points to the parent of the input iterator.

Inputs:

(Iterator)

Output:

Returns an iterator to the parent.

6) get_left_child:

This function returns a pointer which points to the left child of the input iterator.

Inputs:

(Iterator)

Output:

Returns an iterator to the left child.


7) get_right_child:

This function returns a pointer which points to the right child of the input iterator.

Inputs:

(Iterator)

Output:

Returns an iterator to the right child.
